#  Multilingual Mandi  
### Building India's Fair, Voice-First, AI-Powered Local Trade Network

> *An AI for Bharat initiative that strengthens grassroots commerce without disrupting cultural practices.*

---

## 🧩 The Core Problem

India's mandis are the backbone of local trade — yet they remain:
- Linguistically fragmented
- Informal and trust-dependent
- Vulnerable to information asymmetry
- Exposed to unfair price negotiations

Farmers and small vendors often negotiate without:
- Knowledge of real market prices
- Language alignment with buyers
- Digital proof of fair transactions

This leads to **income loss, dependency on middlemen, and economic insecurity**.

---

## 🌏 Ground Reality Insights

Our solution is built on real-world constraints:
- 22+ official languages, hundreds of dialects
- Voice-based negotiations dominate trade
- Low digital literacy and intermittent connectivity
- Trust is personal, not platform-driven

Any effective system must be:
> **Voice-first, multilingual, lightweight, culturally respectful, and AI-augmented — not AI-dominated.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Multilingual Mandi

**Multilingual Mandi** is a **voice-first AI web platform** that creates a **real-time linguistic and economic bridge** between vendors and buyers — without interfering in human negotiation.

It **assists**, not replaces.
